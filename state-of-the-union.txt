INFO

- we can reload UI with vid_restart!


HIGH:

- Understand modules, crates, etc (e.g. difference mod and use)

- solve CString business, maybe use macros to have a nice printing mechanism (compare https://os.phil-opp.com/vga-text-mode/)



LOW:

- Syscallptr as static mut is unsafe (would be better with RwLock but initialisation is stupid)

- Can we replace global state (static mut) with something better, like an instance of something?}
